Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:

["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!


def remove_every_other(my_list):
  return [my_list[i] for i in range(0, len(my_list)) if i % 2 == 0]
